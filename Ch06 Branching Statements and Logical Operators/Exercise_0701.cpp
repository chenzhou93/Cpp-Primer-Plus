/**
 * 7.
 * Write a program that reads input a word at a time until a lone q is entered. 
 * The program should then report the number of words that began with vowels, 
 * the number that began with consonants, 
 * and the number that fit neither of those categories. 
 * 
 * One approach is to use isalpha() to discriminate between words beginning with letters 
 * and those that donâ€™t and 
 * then use an if or switch statement 
 * to further identify those passing the isalpha() test that begin with vowels. 
 * 
 * 
 * A sample run might look like this:
 * 
 * Enter words (q to quit):
 * The 12 awesome oxen ambled
 * quietly across 15 meters of lawn. q
 * 5 words beginning with vowels
 * 4 words beginning with consonants
 * 2 others
 *
