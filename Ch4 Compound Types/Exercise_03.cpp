/*
    3.Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her first name and then last name, 
    and that then constructs, 
    stores, and displays a third string, 
    consisting of the userâ€™s last name followed by a comma, a space, 
    and first name. Use char arrays and functions from the cstring header file. 
    A sample run could look like this:

    Enter your first name: Flip
    Enter your last name: Fleming
    Here's the information in a single string: Fleming, Flip
