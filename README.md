# Cpp-Primer-Plus

This is my solutions for all program exercises for each chapter of C++ Primer Plus.

How to run:

1) Download file.
2) Open one of the child file in terminal.
3) Copy this command line WITHOUT doule quotes to the console to compile : "g++ Exercise_XX.cpp", where XX needs to be replaced to a specific file.
4) Copy this command line WITHOUT doule quotes to the console : "/a.out"(for Mac and Linux), "filename.exe"(for Windows).
